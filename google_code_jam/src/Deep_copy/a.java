	Default version
	of clone
	method creates
	the shallow
	copy of
	an object.
	To create
	the deep
	copy of
	an object, you
	have to
	override clone
	method.
	Shallow copy
	is preferred if
	an object
	has only
	primitive fields.
	Deep copy
	is preferred if
	an object
	has references
	to other
	objects as
	fields.Shallow copy
	is fast
	and also
	less expensive.
	Deep copy
	is slow
	and very expensive.*/
